    <p style="color: #628a65">This picture is a beach I came across on my way back from Sea Cliff Bridge a few months
        ago. Actually, on the way home, I was looking for the toilet because I was in a hurry, So I found it on Google
        Maps. That is why I came here. But The scenery was nice and there were only a few people, so I rested for a
        while in this place with the sound of waves.</p>
